== I see this error message on my screen: Another plugin/theme has made jQuery unavailable for Ajax Event Calendar. ==
  
  * Switch to the Twenty Twelve theme.  If this message disappears and the calendar works, the conflict is caused by your theme - ask the theme author to resolve the issue.

  * If the error message is still present, disable all plugins except the Ajax Event Calendar.  With all possible external conflicts disabled view your the calendar using Firefox browser with [http://getfirebug.com/ Firebug plugin] activated.  

  * If the calendar still does not work !JavaScript errors may appear in the Firebug Console - by file name and line number of each error.

  * If no !JavaScript errors are displayed in the Firebug Console check your /wp-content folder for "debug.log" file - if it exists it may contain errors regarding the cause of the conflict.  If the debug.log file does not exist, check your PHP error log (ask your hosting service if you don't know where that file is located).

  * If no errors appear in either the Firebug Console or the PHP logs, search the [http://code.google.com/p/wp-aec/issues/list?can=1 Issue Tracker] for known bugs and resolutions.

  * If you can't find your issue, submit a bug report on the  [http://code.google.com/p/wp-aec/issues/list?can=1 Issue Tracker], include ALL STEPS necessary to reproduce the issue - if I am unable to reproduce the problem I will not be able to assist.

  * If the calendar works as expected, begin restoring your original plugins one by one, check the calendar after each.
  
  * When the calendar stops functioning, note the error in the firebug console.  If the error is caused by a file in another plugin or a theme, contact that plugin/theme author for assistance.
  
  * Due to time constraints, I am unable to freely offer troubleshooting assistance.  If you're stuck post your questions on the forum so that others can try to help.  And if you are interested in hiring me for consultation or custom solution development, I am available at a fare hourly rate.

== I have a feature request for the plugin, what steps should I take? ==
Search the [http://code.google.com/p/wp-aec/issues/list?can=1 issue tracker] for enhancement requests.
  * If you find your request already in queue, *click on the star* beside the issue number to indicate your interest in the feature.
  * If you don't find your request in queue, submit a feature request include the purpose of the feature and detailed scenarios of how it would be used.

== I want to change the appearance of the calendar/eventlist ==
  * View your site using Firefox browser with [http://getfirebug.com/ Firebug plugin] activated.  Read about using Firebug and learn how to "inspect" page elements for styling.
  * Firebug allows you to adjust the style on a live site, so once you have the desired look, just add the style to *your theme's css* not the custom.css file (the custom.css file will not be preserved when the plugin is updated).  
  * REMEMBER: edits to existing style definitions require use of the *!important* flag after the property value, for example: `#aec-calendar{background:#blue !important;...}`.<br>*BE CAREFUL* this can have unanticipated effects on your design when applied to elements used throughout your theme.  For that reason, it is good practice to use the most specific selectors possible when performing these overrides.
  * If you're stuck post your questions on the forum so that others can try to help.
