== Eeek! Ajax Event Calendar Stopped Working / Doesn't Work ==
This is typically caused by a conflict with another plugin/theme.  Before submitting a bug to the issue tracker, follow these troubleshooting tips to isolate and identify the problem accurately:
  * Switch to the default WordPress Theme (Twenty Twelve as of this update). If the calendar works, the conflict is caused by your theme - ask the theme author to investigate.

  * Still doesn't work...?  Disable all plugins except the Ajax Event Calendar. With all possible external conflicts now disabled, the calendar should work.

  * Still no luck...?  Check your /wp-content folder for a file called "debug.log" - it may contain errors regarding the cause of the conflict.  If there are no errors that directly mention Ajax Event Calendar, check for javascript errors via your browser's javascript console. 

  * JavaScript errors may appear in the console, listing both the filename and the line number of each error.  Reload the calendar page in the browser and note any errors you find.  If any errors mention Ajax Event Calendar, be sure to include them in your bug report.

  * If you use Firefox browser, and I highly recommend using the [http://getfirebug.com/ Firebug plugin] to debug javascript conflicts.

----

  * If the calendar works as expected, begin restoring your original plugins one by one, check the calendar after each.

  * When the calendar stops functioning, you'll have a culprit.  Note the error in the console, it will be helpful when reporting the error to the  plugin/theme developers.

----

  * If no errors appear in either the Firebug Console or the PHP logs, search the [http://code.google.com/p/wp-aec/issues/list?can=1 Issue Tracker] for known bugs and resolutions.

  * If you can't find your issue, submit a bug report on the  [http://code.google.com/p/wp-aec/issues/list?can=1 Issue Tracker], be sure to include ALL STEPS necessary to reproduce the issue - if I am unable to reproduce the problem I will not be able to assist.

  * Finally, I do not freely offer WordPress implementation assistance.  If you are interested in hiring me for consultation, I am available at a fare hourly rate.  

== I have a feature request for the plugin, what steps should I take? ==
Search the [http://code.google.com/p/wp-aec/issues/list?can=1 issue tracker] for enhancement requests.
  * If you find your request already in queue, *click on the star* beside the issue number to indicate your interest in the feature.
  * If you don't find your request in queue, submit a feature request include the purpose of the feature and detailed scenarios of how it would be used.

== I want to change the appearance of the calendar/eventlist ==
  * View your site using Firefox browser with [http://getfirebug.com/ Firebug plugin] activated.  Read about using Firebug and learn how to "inspect" page elements for styling.
  * Firebug allows you to adjust the style on a live site, so once you have the desired look, just add the style to *your theme's css* not the custom.css file (the custom.css file will not be preserved when the plugin is updated).  
  * REMEMBER: edits to existing style definitions require use of the *!important* flag after the property value, for example: `#aec-calendar{background:#blue !important;...}`.<br>*BE CAREFUL* this can have unanticipated effects on your design when applied to elements used throughout your theme.  For that reason, it is good practice to use the most specific selectors possible when performing these overrides.
  * If you're stuck post your questions on the forum so that others can try to help.
